## Memory

Thanks to the automatic memory management, it is easy to write a well-functioning program with Sugilite.

If necessary, the management can be turned off for single variables. These self-managed variables are used as pointers and must be deleted manually.

## Function return values

There are several ways a function can return values.

With the `yank` keyword a. Return value is determined or overwritten. The function is then terminated. This behavior is similar to the `return` from C-like languages.

The `yield` keyword can be used to specify or overwrite a return value of the current function. This does not terminate the function.

## Empty values and errors

To be able to have empty values, the built-in data type `option` is used. `option` can have a value or not.

Errors are mapped with the built-in `result` data type. A `result` can contain a value or an error.
